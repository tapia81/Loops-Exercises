//Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 10,
//it will multiply the number by 9
//and log the result (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18")
//Bonus: Use a nested for loop to show the tables for every
//multiplier from 1 to 10 (100 results total)

//Write a while loop that starts counting from 5.
//Count up to (including) 50 and count only every fifth number
//Don' forget to log it

//Write a function that takes an array of numbers as an argument.
//This function should return the first duplicate number in the array:
// For example: [2,7,5,9,8,7] should return 7;

//Remembering the results from the conditionals exercise on Monday
// use the assignGrade function by logging every value from 60 to 100:
//your log should show "For 88, you got a B" "For 90 you got an A"etc..
